# Project Review: Git Branching

### By: Rachel G

This is a review of Mia's Tutorial on Git branching. This was discussed a bit in class, and I have to say, this is very well done. I'm using her tutorials as a guide for writing my review, and I'm decently familiar with them already, but I was able to learn something new about upstreams. I don't understand them very well, but I can elaborate on that later.

The explanation of branches is very well done. The *Twinkie* metaphor works very well, as much like a lot of baked foods and snack cakes, a lot goes into it and missing one step could affect everything else. The code layout is neat and organized, same with the list of steps. I have some feedback before going to examine the code for this file, but I will write my possible 

## Revision Ideas

There are a few things I suggest adding or adjusting. First and foremost, ```git add .``` isn't the only sequence for pulling code. ```git add -A``` is commonly used, so I'd suggest including that as an "either/or" in the section for "Daily Git Branch Checklist." I don't think there are many differences between them, if any at all, but it's worth noting anyways. 

My next comment is about the screenshot provided from the bash shell. I'm not sure if this is just me, but some information about your system is shown in the photos. I'm aware that it can't be cropped out, at the risk of cropping out other information, but possibly blacking out the information before ```MINGW64``` would be helpful. 

My last comments are about upstream and the page layout. It's an interesting process, but it's also very confusing. I noticed the resource from *Stack Overflow,* but an idea for the future could be including a demonstration or recording a video to explain upstreams in action, as they can be confusing to newcomers in those aspects of branches, like myself. 

The titles for upstreams like "what good is an upstream?" and "the upstream affects git status" blend in with the normal text. Maybe, to help them stand out, make the headers bold so they stand out and grab the reader's attention.

Finally, I noticed that the table of contents is at the top, but also at the bottom. I assume this was done so readers could revisit sections after scrolling through the entire thing? I'm not opposed to it, but I have another idea that may work: instead of copying the entire table of contents, have a button at the bottom of the page that, when clicked, redirects to the table of contents. I feel like it would help save space with the page.

Aside from that, I don't see any issues with the spelling and grammar for this tutorial. I will double-check before the project is due, but you put a lot of effort into this and I'm impressed. Well done!
