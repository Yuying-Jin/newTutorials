# Setting up a Jekyll development environment for GitHub Pages 
First of all, what actually is Jekyll, anyway?
Jekyll is a **static website generator**: It's a *generator* in that it helps automate the construction of your HTML pages, but it outputs a *static site* which means that visitors won't be triggering dynamic server-side interactions when they visit your page. Static sites can handle client-side Javascript interactions, but they don't fundamentally change their content when a visitor interacts with them.  

Jekyll is totally free, distributed under an open source MIT license for anyone to use in web development. It happens to be written in the Ruby language by one of the founders of GitHub ([Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner)), and uses something called "liquid templating" in Ruby, which you'll be adapting and applying as you work with it.
