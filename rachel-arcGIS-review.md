# Project Review: ArcGIS

### By: Rachel G

This is a big project, and I can tell that a lot went into it. In fact, there's still a lot going into it because several areas are still under development. I don't hold it against Grace at all, since this is an ongoing project. I'll describe this more in my revision ideas, but this tutorial is very text-heavy, and I spotted a few minor typos. Mostly, it was something missing a letter like "panel" is spelled "pane" in a few places, but those are an easy fix. ArcGIS was misspelled early on too, but I think most of the typos will be caught when copying and pasting text into an engine like *Microsoft Word* or *Google Docs.*

The tutorial will work well for Penn State students, but not much else, since the students access ArcGIS with their student accounts. It is justified, however, in the fact that the majority of people viewing this tutorial will be Penn State students. I do wish something was addressed in the installation progress of having to close the tab about ArcGIS extraction once it's already done, because it doesn't do that automatically. That's a small thing though, and the rest of my critique is listed below.

## Revision Ideas

I feel that this tutorial could have used some more visual aids. When I first opened up a map with ArcGIS, I had trouble finding out where everything was through the text alone. Maybe it would be helpful on the section where the program's layout is discussed for the first time, A screenshot could be provided as a reference with items such as the contents and toolbar being highlighted and/or marked as "figure A, figure B" so on and so forth in the "how to create a new map project" section. Using arrows to point things out wouldn't hurt either.

My other suggestion would be to list any programs or tools provided by ArcGIS to see if the database will run well on a specific computer or operating system. It was mentioned that the database can be used in browsers, but it may run poorly or be unable to run at all on aging computers or computers with cheap specs. If it can't provide a complete analysis of if the specs will run the database, I hope a minimum can be found or provided.

With that said, I feel you are doing well. There's a lot left to do, but I hope you can use what I have to say so far to finish this project.
